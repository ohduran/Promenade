Promenade
=====================================

This is an experiment: Can we run a social media agency in the open?
Can we reverse engineer the conditions for being followed by +1,000 people, real people?
Can we leverage what we know about games to win the game of all games?

This is Promenade. Gazing at the ocean of possibilities, fearless.

1 Boundary conditions
-----------------

Boundary conditions uniquely determine what we are not, so that people can infer what Promenade is
from what is left.

A. All software is open source and GPL Licensed. That means that we understand that the software used comes
from the open source community, and it must return to it.

B. All metrics must be shared publicly, which keeps us accountable not only to the stakeholders,
but also to the people in general.
