# Introduction

Promenade is an open-source web application that allows you to interact with automatic Instagram accounts to enhance your social media interactions.


## Purpose
Promenade aims at revolutionise how Instagram is professionally handled. [You can never tell how good a community manager is](http://paulgraham.com/taste.html). If data tells us something, then we might as well hear what it has to say.

## Features

## Who is it for?
For Instagram users: Promenade allows them to test how viral a post, or an account, could potentially be.

## What Promenade isn't
Promenade isn't a 'get rich quick scheme'. You can't buy engagement, [you can't make someone love you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfWWIZ-q00U).

## Where does this tool come from?
I have been tinkering with Instagram and Twitter APIs for some time, but they limit the scope of the things you can do with them. Eventually, I listened to a podcast episode of [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/142/automating-the-web-with-selenium-and-instapy) featuring the creator of [InstaPy](https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy), and the wheels started turning. My experience with RESTful APIs did the rest. An unofficial version of the Instagram API was on the way.

# Get started

To be defined

## Requirements
This software runs on Docker. Everything is pulled from the docker hub, but to work with it locally, docker must be installed. More info on how to set up locally is to be defined.

# Contribute
Do you want to help? That's awesome. Here's a couple of things you can do:

## As a member of the community
Share, talk about it, spread the word. Even if they don't understand what it is the first time, tell them more.

## As a developer
I can do with some help bringing this project forward! You can help out in very different ways:

* Read our [Contribution Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
* Install the developer version locally so you can start contributing.
* Look for [issues labelled bugs](https://github.com/ohduran/Promenade/labels/bug) for immediate impact on the project.
* Look for [issues labelled Help wanted](https://github.com/ohduran/Promenade/labels/help%20wanted) for issues that you can solve relatively easily.
* Look for [issues labelled Good first issue](https://github.com/ohduran/Promenade/labels/good%20first%20issue) for issues that are for people who want to contribute, but try to work on a small feature first.
* If you are an advanced developer, you can try to tackle [issues labelled enhancement](https://github.com/ohduran/Promenade/labels/enhancement). Beware though - they are harder to do and will require a lot of back and forth with the repository administrator in order to make sure we are going to the right direction with the product.

# Principles

* Software is information, and information must be free.

* Software is writing, and every writing must tell a story that can be easily understood.

* Software is a tool, and the value added from that tool comes from the people that use it, not from the tool itself.

* Software is mutable, but at any step, software must not need the help of a human to run.

* Software is a map of the world, and those who use them must understand that the map is never the territory.


# Why Open Source?

Open source is not only not a risky move for a company to pursue, but a perfectly sensible business decision. Despite overwhelming evidence, non-technical people are worried about risks surrounding open-source, like amateur chefs are worried that someone might steal their recipes if they share them.

I am convince that the value added by any business has little to do with the code itself and more with its ability to serve its customers, the culture and the commitment to hire the best people possible in all fields. Open sourcing core IP can upset your competitors as long as these areas are strong.

Usually the one open sourcing the technology is the expert in the area, so any company running away with someone else's code to build a better business may still be at a disadvantage.

I also believe that open sourcing creates value by contributing to the team's culture and your ability to hire good people. There is more social value and technical reputation in giving away your best stuff than keeping it proprietary.
