## Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Promenade. We need people like you to make Promenade the best tool it can be.

Before you do anything else, please read the [README.md](readme.md) of this project first.
This is where we highlight the vision and the strategy. Please make sure you
accept this vision before contributing to this project.

### 1. Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a question, [make an issue](https://github.com/ohduran/Promenade/issues/new),
we'll try to answer it as fast as possible.

### 2. Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then
[fork Promenade](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations
```

### 3. Get the test suite running

Make sure you follow the [instructions](https://github.com/monicahq/monica/blob/master/docs/contribute/index.md#testing-environment)
on how to setup the test suite.

### 4. Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/ohduran/Promenade/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
[open a new one](https://github.com/ohduran/Promenade/issues/new).
Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case**
demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.

### 5. Implement your fix or feature

* At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help;
everyone is a beginner at first :smile:
* Write a good commit message. To write good commit messages, please follow
[these recommendations](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
There are important to maintain a healthy commit logs.
* If there are multiple commits in your pull request, these commits will be
squashed before merging. Please make sure, if that's the case, that your pull
request has a nice description explaining what it does.
* It's okay to have work-in-progress pull requests. Add `[WIP]` in the title of
your pull request if that's the case, otherwise your pull request will be
considered in a state of being able to be merged as is.
* If you wish to appear as a contributor, update the CONTRIBUTORS file and
add your name to it. Include this change in your pull request.

### 6. Wait for the code to be reviewed

A healthy environment trumps everything else: thus, it can take some days before a reviewer can look at the code you have submitted. I am committed to do the best I can, but that's only the best possible outcome, and it may not be enough to review everything instantly.

Also, keep in mind that this project is still a side project. Maintainers of
this project are not paid to work on it. Everything they do, is done during
their time off of their "real" job, that means at night, on the weekend and
during holidays.

### 7. What can I contribute to?

From grammar reviews to big feature requests, every change, even the simplest, is appreciated. No change is too small.
